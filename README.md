I'm learning some basic statistics with applications by following along with
the old [MIT 18.443 Statistics for
Applications](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-443-statistics-for-applications-fall-2006/)
course on OpenCourseWare. Note that this is the Fall 2006 version of the
course, which I picked because I liked the book. The newest version of the
course ([18.650 -- Fall
2016](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-650-statistics-for-applications-fall-2016/))
     has no textbook at all. But so far I like having a textbook.

 The course was taught using matlab, but I'm using numpy/scipy/matplotlib for
 Python instead. I couldn't get the original data sets, so I'm scrounging some
 together to play with.
